Koṭikarna, the son of Bālasena, was born with an earring of incredible value. Once, as he travelled
across the sea as a trader, he lost all his friends on his way back, and all alone
he travels through the Preta world and some of the lowest Hells. The inmates of Hell gave
him messages for their descendants, and with the help of the supernatural power of a Preta
he manages to go home in his sleep. Then he went to Mahākātyāyana and requested to be accepted
into the saṃgha, but Mahākātyāyana reminded him that he had to bring his messages first.
Then, after the death of his parents, he was accepted into the saṃgha by Mahākātyāyana.
He then went to see the Buddha, and, on the Mahākātyāyana’s request, that he had difficulties
in finding ten monks in peripheral places for the purpose of ordination. Then the
Buddha decided that five monks for ordination was enough. Koṭikarna further relate that in
peripheral places it was customary to use leather and skins, and this was also allowed by
the Buddha. The concept (aśmāparāntako janapadaḥ) “peripheral place” was defined. Panglung
