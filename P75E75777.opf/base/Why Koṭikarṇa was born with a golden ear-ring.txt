The Buddha then explained why Koṭikarna was born in a rich family with an earring of incredible
value: The trader (Koṭikarna in an earlier incarnation) who spend an earring for the renovation
of a stūpa.After the death of the Buddha Kāśyapa King Kṛkin built a stūpa, and he
decreed that all the charges imposed at the eastern gate should go to the maintenance of
the stūpa. But after the death of the king a minister closed the gate with masonry, and the
stūpa did not get any more of income. Then a trader from the North saw the dilapidating
stūpa and spent his earring to have it renovated. On his way back the trader saw that the
stūpa was wonderfully repaired and renovated, he was delighted by this and spent even more
for the purpose. He then made the wish that he could be born in a rich family, and that
he would have the opportunity to meet a Buddha like Kāśyapa. Panglung p. 16.
